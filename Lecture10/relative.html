    <p>Arjun always believed that life worked in patterns. He woke up at the same time, ate the same breakfast, and walked the same road to his college every day. Nothing ever surprised him—until the morning he found a small, silver key lying on the footpath.

It looked ordinary, yet strangely heavy in his palm. He slipped it into his pocket, thinking it belonged to someone nearby. That night, while studying, he noticed a faint glow coming from his bag. The key shimmered as if alive.

Curiosity overpowered caution. Arjun tried the key on his desk drawer—it didn’t fit. Then, on impulse, he held it against the old wooden box his grandfather had given him years ago, one he had never been able to open. The lock clicked.

Inside were letters written in his grandfather’s neat handwriting, describing a “hidden room” in their ancestral home, a place “where stories guard themselves.”

The next weekend, Arjun traveled back to his village. With shaky hands, he used the silver key again—this time on a faded door in the storeroom. The hinges groaned open. What he saw inside wasn’t dust or cobwebs. It was shelves filled with books—stories written by his grandfather, waiting to be read.</p>
