Ninja Hattori is a beloved Japanese anime and manga series that has captured the hearts of children across the world. Created by Fujiko Fujio, the same duo behind the iconic Doraemon, the story revolves around a young ninja named Kanzo Hattori from the Iga clan. Sent from the mountains to the city, Hattori becomes part of the Mitsuba family, where he befriends Kenichi, a mischievous and often lazy schoolboy. From that moment on, Hattori dedicates himself to guiding and protecting Kenichi using his ninja skills, wisdom, and strong sense of morality.

Despite being a trained ninja, Hattori is not a warrior in the traditional sense. Instead of fighting evil villains or going on dangerous missions, he uses his skills to help Kenichi deal with everyday problems—whether it’s school pressure, bullying, or personal growth. His tools and techniques include smoke bombs, invisibility tricks, transformation scrolls, and clever disguises, all used in humorous and creative ways. Hattori is often seen quoting his motto: “A ninja must be honest and brave,” which sums up his character and the values he tries to teach.

The show's success lies not only in Hattori’s character but also in its supporting cast. Shinzō, Hattori’s adorable little brother, is trying to learn the ways of the ninja but often ends up creating more chaos than help. Their pet dog, Shishimaru, is a chubby, lazy ninja dog who loves to eat and often gets involved in silly situations. Then there’s Kemumaki, a rival ninja from the Koga clan who attends the same school as Kenichi. Though Kemumaki is a troublemaker, he’s not evil—he simply serves as a competitive foil to Hattori. His cat, Kagechiyo, often competes with Shishimaru, adding more fun to the narrative.

One of the show’s greatest strengths is how it mixes action, comedy, and life lessons. </div>
